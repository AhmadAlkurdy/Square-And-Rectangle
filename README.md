# Square-And-Rectangle
1- find the first zero in the first loop
       2- find another zero in the same ro
       3- loop to looks for zero in the same locations in different rows
      the only problem with this algorithm that when i request the max numbers of the matrix
      it takes about 5 second to be processed
